# Project 2 Mitchell Skelton u3236482 Front-End Web Design 11056

## Reflection
Already knowing one of the best AI assistants ChatGPT I didn’t have to do much research into finding out about it. I did some brainstorming on what website I was going to design and landed on designing for a Japanese Restaurant. After this I began by creating the html page I was going to use and setting up all the other CSS and JavaScript files needed for this project. Initially I generated my code through ChtaGPT where I gave it some prompts to create the website based off. The prompts are as follows:
1.	Code a website using a dark colour scheme for a Japanese sushi restaurant, include a big hero content with text of the restaurant name and an image. Please also make a card like system where the menu items are displayed on each card, this card system should be displayed in rows of 3 using css grid.
2.	Please make the background black and have the card border as a glowing white 2px
3.	Please make it so the cards do not come within 10% of the edge of the screen

### ChatGPT Initall Generation

After this initial generation from ChatGPT I started to work on the website coding myself. I started to add in a navigation bar above what ChatGPT generated and properly styled the generated code to my liking. I sourced an image for the hero content and applied it to a grid system where the title of the restaurant was on the left and the image was on the right. I then stated to work on the menu that ChatGPT generated for me which was pretty helpful. I tweaked ChatGPTs code to get rid of the initial white glowing border as I didn’t like it anymore and instead had the border appear on hover. After finishing with ChatGPTs initial code I started to implement my own additions after having some ideas. I added an about section where the user can read about the restaurant which was generated by ChatGPT.
