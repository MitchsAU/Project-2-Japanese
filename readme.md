# Project 2 Mitchell Skelton u3236482 Front-End Web Design 11056

## Reflection
Already knowing one of the best AI assistants ChatGPT I didnâ€™t have to do much research into finding out about it. I began by creating the html page I was going to use and setting up all the other CSS and JavaScript files needed for this project. Initially I generated my code through ChtaGPT where I gave it some prompts to create the website based off. The prompts are as follows:
1.	Code a website using a dark colour scheme for a Japanese sushi restaurant, include a big hero content with text of the restaurant name and an image. Please also make a card like system where the menu items are displayed on each card, this card system should be displayed in rows of 3 using css grid.
2.	Please made the background super black and have the card border as a glowing white 2px
3.	Please make it so the cards do not come within 10% of the edge of the screen
